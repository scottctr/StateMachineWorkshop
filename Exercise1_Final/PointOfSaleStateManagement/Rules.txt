5. Can only accept payment if balance < 0
6. Skip - replaced by 8a
7. No changes to paid sales
   - Paid = 0 balance, 1+ items, 1+ payments
8. Need to be able to cancel a sale
   a. If payments on sale, must give change for total payment amounts before cancelling
      - This negates rule 2: “Can only give change when balance > 0”
   b. No changes to cancelled sales
      - Can’t modify items, add payments, give change, or cancel
9. Can’t create a new sale until current sale is paid or cancelled
- Implementation note: Set Index.cs/IncludeCancel = true
